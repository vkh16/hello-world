# hello-world
This repository relates to the hello world GitHub introduction tutorial 
I am trying to figure out what GitHub is and what it does with this tutorial exercise. 
I am finding it very annoying that all my typing is on one line when I preview this document even though I am typing on different lines.
A quick Google search shows me that there are two ways to fix this. One is to put two spaces at the end of each line. Does this work?  
Did it work?  
Wow, yes putting 2 spaces at the end of a line and then typing on the next line will work. Â 
The other method?  
To use <br /> tag. <br />
Haha. That didn't show up because it worked so well. If you use the tag "< br />" without the "" marks and without the space after the first <  it will take you to a new line without showing the tag used to get onto the next line. <br /> 
Apparently this used to be a feature of 'GitHub-flavored markdown' whatever that is <br />
You should spend some time learning what that is <br />
I am done making changes. First let's commit changes (which I think is just the way GitHub refers to saving something?!) and then Let's try to change the master branch.
